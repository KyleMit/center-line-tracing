"""Pruning as model selection — pruning as model selection.

Instead of hand-tuning one threshold, prune at several strengths, re-stroke each
candidate, and choose. Two selection rules are provided:

  * `pareto_front`  — the candidates that are not dominated on
                      (reconstruction error, complexity);
  * `simplest_within_tolerance` — Experiment 4 proper: of the candidates whose
                      reconstruction error is within a tolerance of the best
                      achievable, take the simplest.

The second is the one to use. It is what lets each backend be evaluated at ITS
OWN best setting instead of at whatever threshold someone happened to pick, and
it converts a fiddly constant into a defensible, reproducible choice.
