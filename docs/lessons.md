# Lessons — things that bit, and will bite again

Every entry here cost real time. Several of them produced confident, wrong,
*published* numbers before they were caught. They are kept because the failure
modes are structural, not incidental to who hit them.

## <a id="medial_axis-is-non-deterministic-by-default"></a>`medial_axis` is non-deterministic by default

`skimage.morphology.medial_axis(image, ..., rng=None)` randomises the pixel
ordering used to break thinning ties. With the default `rng=None`, **two calls on
the same mask return different skeletons.** Verified on scikit-image 0.26:

```
identical across 4 calls: False     # rng=None  (default)
identical across 4 calls: True      # rng=0
```

The pixel *count* is stable, so this hides easily: it shows up as scores that
wobble by ~±0.01 IoU between otherwise identical runs — more than enough to make a
real regression invisible or to invent one. Fixed here by
`ExtractConfig.rng_seed = 0`, passed on every call. `skeletonize()` has no such
parameter and is deterministic.

## Feeding fit-curve an RDP-simplified polyline produces garbage

A near-collinear 3-point run makes Schneider's tangent/α solve ill-conditioned, and
it returns control points flung across the canvas — a visible loop that still
passes the algorithm's own error test. Corpus case 02 scored IoU 0.771 for exactly
this reason while its *centerline* error was 0.065: the geometry was fine and the
fit was not.

Fix, and both halves are needed: fit on a **uniformly arc-length resampled** chain
(`extract.resample_uniform`, step `R_med/8`), and keep a sanity check that rejects
control points outside the run's bbox + 35% of its diagonal and subdivides instead
(`fit_curve.js: sane()`). Anyone else using fit-curve should copy both.

## IoU is a weak discriminator for centerline quality, and can be anti-correlated with it

Same case as above: IoU ranked `skeletonize` (0.858) above `medial-axis` (0.771)
while ground truth said medial-axis was 2.7× more accurate. If you have ground
truth, score against it. IoU is for the real inputs where you do not — and the
pruning selector optimizes symmetric difference rather than IoU precisely because
IoU is forgiving of small missing marks, which is the over-pruning failure mode.

## Canonicalize before pruning, and after every pass

Backends disagree about what an edge *is* — for one noisy capsule, 426 edges from
one extractor and 61 from another. Pruning an un-canonicalized graph at λ=1.0
destroyed it: 426 edges → 11, IoU 0.77 → 0.28. `CenterlineGraph.merge_chains()` is
not an optimization, it is a precondition. It splices degree-2 chains, records
provenance in the surviving edge's `mergedFrom`, and is geometry-preserving.

## Surviving-edge bookkeeping needs the merge provenance, not the edge ids

Because canonicalization splices chains, a branch that survives pruning carries its
neighbours' ids in `mergedFrom` rather than leaving them as separate edges.
Filtering the extractor's edge list on the surviving *ids alone* drops most of the
drawing. The kept set is the union of each surviving edge's own id and its
`mergedFrom` list. `src/run.py` does this; anything else that maps a pruned graph
back onto extractor edges must too.

## Do not re-render a pruned graph through the generic writer

`clg`'s SVG writer collapses an edge to a single median radius and emits dense
polylines. That is correct for an overlay or a diff and wrong for anything a
person looks at: per-vertex width and the Bézier fit are exactly what make this
output 34× lighter than the tool it replaced, and the generic writer throws both
away. Pruning has to be applied *inside the extractor's model* and emitted by the
extractor's emitter.

## Never let a harness write into the directory it reads from

A scoring harness promoted each winner into the same directory its *inputs* lived
in, so every run scored the previous run's pruned output as "what was published".
Four of ten cells had drifted before it was caught — always in the flattering
direction. Know whether a directory is an input, an output, or both, and never let
it be both. In this repo:

- `outputs/` is written **only** by `src/run.py`, and read by the contact sheet.
- `runs/out/`, `runs/graphs/`, `runs/promoted/` are the bench's regenerable cache.
  `bench.py --promote` writes to `runs/promoted/`, deliberately *not* to
  `outputs/`, so a sweep can never leave the shipped drawings at whatever config
  was last tried.

## <a id="a-comparison-render-must-differ-by-one-thing-only"></a>A comparison render must differ by one thing only

Both sides of every contact-sheet pair go through the same rasterizer at the same
pixel size on the same white ground. Get any of those wrong and the mismatch shows
up as a seam at the wipe line, where it reads as a flaw in the *output* rather
than in the render. For the same reason the difference view is deliberately not
contrast-boosted: the error really is a sub-pixel halo, and making it visible
would be making it up.

## Profile before believing a written-down diagnosis

A previous handoff stated that a drawing never finished because `merge_chains` is
O(V²). It is not: on that graph `merge_chains` takes 0.0 s and makes zero merges.
The real cost was unindexed point-to-boundary distance in
`metrics.boundary_distances` — a linear scan over every boundary segment for every
sample point, 97 s per `score_graph`. An STRtree over the exploded boundary made it
13× faster with distances identical to 1e-13 over 268k samples. A confident
diagnosis nobody profiled had become the next session's task list.

## Source polygons need real fill-rule handling

Ring-parity nesting inflated `house-wide`'s area by 25% and made the output look
like it was missing a fifth of the drawing. `clg/svgio.py` nodes the rings,
polygonizes, and classifies faces by winding number. **If a new metric says
everything is failing, suspect the metric.**

## Chain merging must not assume edges meet at their shared node

Extractor geometry drifts from node coordinates — up to 13.7 user units in graphs
seen here, which is larger than a stroke radius in places. Dropping the shared
vertex unconditionally deleted 997 units² across 51 fragments. Anything that
splices, walks, or closes a path must tolerate a gap of several user units.

## Use `radiusProfile`, not a per-edge median

Scoring `house-wide` with the per-vertex radius profile rather than a per-edge
median improved reconstruction error from 0.0243 to 0.0152 — a 37% reduction. A
single median radius is wrong for any edge that spans a width change, and
canonicalization creates such edges by construction.

## `compare.js` measures something else

It diffs *colour* over the whole canvas; the vector metric is symmetric difference
over *ink*. The same output can read 0.02% by one and ~0.5% by the other. Quote
both or neither. A re-emitted black SVG scores ~3.7% against a coloured input for
no geometric reason at all.

## Marching outward from a skeleton end: check the degree first

The first cap-extension implementation extended *both* ends of every branch,
including ends sitting at a junction. Marching outward from a junction runs down
the middle of the crossing stroke and hits the far boundary, pushing branches
across junctions. The same bug in a cap-artifact *detector* reported every junction
as a cap artifact — 73 of 90 edges, versus 22 after the fix. Restrict to degree-1
ends.

## "One variant published" is not "not tunable"

It is *unknown*. On the leading configuration, sweeping a parameter nobody had
swept was worth 8% error and 17% wobble. If a setting has only ever been run at
one value, that is a gap in the measurement, not evidence it is optimal.

## Dropping sub-pixel fragments is load-bearing, and must not be reported as a failure

Several source files contain sub-pixel path fragments (0.4–0.9 user units across).
They are correctly dropped and counted as `subpixelElementsDropped`. Conflating
them with lost strokes inflates the `missing narrow segment` tag and hides real
regressions.

## Long jobs in a hosted agent session

The container suspends between turns, so background jobs barely advance while you
wait on them. Run benches in the foreground. `bench.py` writes after every cell,
so a partial run survives.
