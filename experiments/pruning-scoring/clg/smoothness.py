"""How natural does the line look? — scale-free measures of micro-detail.

The reconstruction metrics in `metrics.py` answer "does the re-stroked artwork
cover the original?". They are blind to a specific and important failure: a path
can hit that target by **wiggling along the outline**, chasing every boundary
irregularity with dozens of tiny course corrections. It scores well and looks
nothing like a stroke a person drew.

Everything here is normalized by the local stroke width, for the same reason the
pruning threshold is: a wobble of 2 user units is invisible on a 40-unit-wide
stroke and glaring on a 4-unit one.

The four measures, from cheapest to most meaningful:

    vertsPerWidth       vertices per stroke width of arc length
    turningPerWidth     radians of |direction change| per stroke width
    reversalsPerWidth   direction-reversals per stroke width — the zig-zag rate
    wiggle              RMS distance from the path's own low-pass version,
                        in stroke radii, with the cutoff set at one stroke width

`wiggle` is the one to trust. The low-pass cutoff is deliberately tied to stroke
width, which encodes the actual claim: **detail finer than the pen is not
drawing, it is noise.** A wide smooth curve keeps all its shape and scores near
zero; a jittery line does not.
